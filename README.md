plugincheck is the future new backend for `https://www.mozilla.org/plugincheck/`.

This contains the JSON datastore and a suite of tools for documenting and validating it.

```
docs/   - static files to publish, including the json datastore
tests/  - scripts to validate the quality of the datastore
/       - project metafiles
```
